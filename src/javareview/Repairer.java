// Our final class is Repairer that extends Human

// repairComputer should take in two arguments that are both ArrayLists<Computer> of computers.
// One ArrayList should be a list of broken computers for the Repairer to take from
// The other ArrayList should be a list of fixed computers for the Repairer to put
// the computer once it works.
// When repairComputer is called the Repairer should take a computer from the broken pile,
// fix it and put it in the fixed pile.
// Remember that there is not a setter for isBroken so the Repairer has to figure something
// else out.
