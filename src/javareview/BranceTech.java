//We're going to make a computer repair shop.
// First we need to make a computer project.
// The computer object should have 3 properties.
// 1. A string for the computer name
// 2. A boolean isPowerOn
// 3. A boolean isBroken
// All properties need getters and setters EXCEPT isBroken need a getter but NO setter

// BranceTech.java is our store and where everything happens
// It needs to have 2 static properties that are both ArrayLists
// One ArrayList should be named brokenComputers and the other should be named fixedComputers

import java.util.ArrayList;

public class BranceTech {
    // These ArrayLists are static and are specific to the BranceTech class
    private static ArrayList<Computer> brokenComputers = new ArrayList<>();
    private static ArrayList<Computer> fixedComputers = new ArrayList<>();

    // One instance of Clerk and one instance of Repairer for the store
    private static Clerk brance = new Clerk("Brance");
    private static Repairer johnny = new Repairer("Johnny");

        Computer jimmysComputer = new Computer("Lapple", false, true);

        Computer testComputerOne = new Computer("Dell", false, true);

        // Brance the clerk receives computers
        brance.receiveComputer(testComputerOne, brokenComputers);
        brance.receiveComputer(testComputerTwo, brokenComputers);
        brance.customerService(jimmy, brokenComputers);

        // Loop shows that all computers have been added to the broken pile.
        for(Computer computer : brokenComputers){
            System.out.println("computer.getName() = " + computer.getName());
        }

        // Johnny the Repairer fixes two computers
        johnny.repairComputer(brokenComputers, fixedComputers);
        johnny.repairComputer(brokenComputers, fixedComputers);

        // We loop again to show that the broken pile only has one computer in it
        System.out.println("---------");
        for(Computer computer : brokenComputers){
            System.out.println("computer.getName() = " + computer.getName());
        }

        // We loop through the fixed pile and see the two computers that Johnny the Repairer has fixed
        System.out.println("---------");
        for(Computer computer : fixedComputers){
            System.out.println("computer.getName() = " + computer.getName());
            System.out.println("computer.isBroken() = " + computer.isBroken());
        }
    }
}

// Does this work?
// Add two more static properties in BranceTech.java
// Make one Clerk and one Repairer
// Make some computers in BranceTech.java main method and call the clerk's receive computer method
// over and over again and pass the computers to it one at a time.
// The broken pile should have all the computers given to the clerk.
// Everytime the repairer's repairComputer method is called a computer should be taken from the brokenPile and put into the fixedPile
// with the isBroken property set to false.
